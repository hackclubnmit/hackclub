# Web Login Authentication üîí

In this workshop, you'll build a secure web login page using [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/).

Firebase is a platform developed by Google for creating mobile and web applications.

You will make something like this üëá

[Check out this demo of the final product!](https://Loginauth.tanishqsoni.repl.co)

You can test out the demo site using the following credentials:

- Email: `login@authentication.com`
- Password: `password`

### Getting Started üöÄ

To get started, you should have a basic knowledge of:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

So let's begin üí®

## Creating a Firebase project üíª

First, you will need to [sign in to Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) using a Google account. If you don't have one, you can [create one here](https://accounts.google.com/signup).

After signing in, you will see a page similar to this:

![Firebase landing](https://cloud-mketa8pxq.vercel.app/1.png)

In the image above, you'll see the `Go to console` button at the top right corner. Click on that, and you will be redirected to the console section.

![Project page](https://cloud-kfr44a6da.vercel.app/2.png)

In the console section, you'll see all your Firebase projects and the `Add Project` button. Click on the `Add Project` button to create a new project.

![Create project](https://cloud-nfiwmg8kh.vercel.app/3.png)

Here you have to give a name to your Firebase project such as `Login-auth`.

Here is an optional step where you can use Google Analytics for your project, but in this workshop, you won't need it. After giving a name to your project click the continue button to proceed further.

![Analytics page](https://cloud-pva80oxrl.vercel.app/4.png)

![Project created](https://cloud-3swaas1pn.vercel.app/5.png)

Now you should see `Your new project is ready`.

Hooray! üéâ You just created a new Firebase project.

## Connecting Firebase to your webpage üîó

After successfully creating the Firebase project you will see your project console.

At the project's console landing page you will see `Get started by adding Firebase to your app`. Below that you will see three options of integrations:

1. iOS
2. Android
3. `</>` (this option is for web which we are using so click on that)

![Project Console](https://cloud-l7pn8f9e9.vercel.app/6.png)

After clicking `</>` a new page will pop up and ask you for a name for your app. For this workshop we will use `login-auth` as the app name.

![App nickname](https://cloud-8tdv8wfuj.vercel.app/8.png)

Here is an **important** part!

You will now see some JavaScript code. This code helps your website connect to your Firebase project. Make sure you copy and paste this somewhere as it is required later.

After saving the code click on `continue to console`.

![API keys](https://cloud-nsps2klza.vercel.app/9.png)

After that you need to add the existing users so that they can login. For that you need to enable **Email/Password** authentication in your project's Authentication section. To do that you need to click on the tab `Authentication` on the top left `Develop` section.

![Authentication page](https://cloud-pnq6xn3gp.vercel.app/10.png)

Here in the Authentication page, you'll see different tabs:

- Users
- Sign-in method
- Templates
- Usage

Click on the Sign-in method.

![Sign in method](https://cloud-nvyxode6r.vercel.app/11.png)

Here you need to enable **Email/Password** in the `sign-in providers` section. Click on **Email/Password**, enable it, then save it.

![Enable email-pass](https://cloud-2vpwetbvx.vercel.app/12.png)

After enabling, you need to add users, so click on the `Users` tab.

![Add user](https://cloud-kbxm635o2.vercel.app/13.png)

Then click on `Add User` and add an `Email` and `Password` for that user. Once done click `Add User`.

![Save user](https://cloud-l38zbxdt7.vercel.app/14.png)

## Designing a webpage üñäÔ∏è

First, you need to set up a coding environment. I suggest you use [Repl.it](https://repl.it) as it sets everything for you with just one click.

To get started, go to [https://repl.it/languages/html](https://repl.it/languages/html).

It looks like this üëá

<a href="https://repl.it/languages/html" target="_blank"><img src="https://cloud-g2gwlwjtx.vercel.app/c2.png" alt="Repl page" ></a>

### Coding Part </>

#### HTML

When you take a look at the `index.html` file in your repl you'll see the `<html>` tag which is the root of the HTML file. Inside the `<html>` tag you'll see the `<body>` tag. This is the main body of the HTML file and contains all the content for our webpage.

You will also find lines like:

- `<link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">`, which links your CSS file (`style.css`) with the HTML.
- `<script src="script.js"></script>`, which links your JavaScript file (`script.js`) with the HTML. It should be placed just above closing body tag `</body>`.

In the `<body>` tag, you need to create two divisions. The first division is for the login page and the second is for the logout page.

##### Division 1:

Create your first division (`<div>`) with a class `main_div` and assign ID `login_div`.

You can also give a heading to your page using heading tags (`<h1>,<h2>,<h3>.....`).

In this division, you will create two input fields for an email and password using the `<input>` tag with `type` set as `email` and `password` respectively. Assign IDs to both input fields as `email_field` and `password_field` respectively.

You can also add the `placeholder` attribute which specifies a short hint that describes the expected value of an input field / textarea.

Here you will also create a login button using the `<button>` tag and assign an onclick function called `login` (remember parenthesis to call the function) to it. Finally, close your first division using `</div>`.

So here's how your first division should look:

```HTML
<div class="main_div" id="login_div">
    <h3>Login Authentication</h3>
    <input type="email" placeholder="Email..." id="email_field">
    <input type="password" placeholder="Password..." id="password_field">
    <button onclick="login()">Login</button>
</div>
```

##### Division 2:

Create your second division below the first with a class of `loggedin_div` and assign an ID of `user_div`.

In this division, you will create a logout button and assign an onclick function called `logout` (remember parenthesis to call the function) to it.

So here's how your second division looks like:

```HTML
<div class="loggedin_div" id="user_div">
    <h3>YAYYY! You successfully logged-in using Firebase.....</h3>
    <button onclick="logout()">Logout</button>
</div>
```

Add this division just after the first division.

So here is what your HTML code should look like so far:

```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width">
  <title>Login Authentication</title>
  <link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
</head>
<body>
<div class="main_div" id="login_div">
  <h3>Login Authentication</h3>
  <input type="email" placeholder="Email..." id="email_field">
  <input type="password" placeholder="Password..." id="password_field">
  <button onclick="login()">Login</button>
</div>
<div class="loggedin_div" id="user_div">
  <h3>YAYYY! You successfully logged-in using Firebase.....</h3>
  <button onclick="logout()">Logout</button>
</div>
<script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

![without JS](https://cloud-ff66h83qt.vercel.app/0u1.png)

As you can see, both divisions are being displayed on the same page. You need to display the second division after the user successfully logged-in as it contains the logout button.

For that, you need to use JavaScript. But before moving on, remember you saved some lines of JavaScript code from Firebase? They should look something like this:

```html
<script src="https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/7.19.1/firebase-app.js"></script>
<script>
  // Your web app's Firebase configuration
  var firebaseConfig = {
    apiKey: 'AIzaSyAVNeXl4cBro95I3dFWMaiT2rI88sqyBtc',
    authDomain: 'loginauth-12.firebaseapp.com',
    databaseURL: 'https://loginauth-12.firebaseio.com',
    projectId: 'loginauth-12',
    storageBucket: 'loginauth-12.appspot.com',
    messagingSenderId: '308714255384',
    appId: '1:308714255384:web:98e87065f0e45910f0ff6d',
  }
  // Initialize Firebase
  firebase.initializeApp(firebaseConfig)
</script>
```

Here is an **important** step, look at very first line of code:

```html
<script src="https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/7.19.1/firebase-app.js"></script>
```

This will give you an error, as it only loads the Firebase library. So for that, add the line below under that first line.

```html
<script src="https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/4.8.1/firebase.js"></script>
```

After adding it, your code should look like this:

```html
<script src="https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/7.19.1/firebase-app.js"></script>
<script src="https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/4.8.1/firebase.js"></script>
<script>
  // Your web app's Firebase configuration
  var firebaseConfig = {
    apiKey: 'AIzaSyAVNeXl4cBro95I3dFWMaiT2rI88sqyBtc',
    authDomain: 'loginauth-12.firebaseapp.com',
    databaseURL: 'https://loginauth-12.firebaseio.com',
    projectId: 'loginauth-12',
    storageBucket: 'loginauth-12.appspot.com',
    messagingSenderId: '308714255384',
    appId: '1:308714255384:web:98e87065f0e45910f0ff6d',
  }
  // Initialize Firebase
  firebase.initializeApp(firebaseConfig)
</script>
```

So, paste the code above right after the second division.

Here is your final HTML code:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />
    <title>Login Authentication</title>
    <link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <div class="main_div" id="login_div">
      <h3>Login Authentication</h3>
      <input type="email" placeholder="Email..." id="email_field" />
      <input type="password" placeholder="Password..." id="password_field" />
      <button onclick="login()">Login</button>
    </div>
    <div class="loggedin_div" id="user_div">
      <h3>YAYYY! You successfully logged-in using Firebase.....</h3>
      <button onclick="logout()">Logout</button>
    </div>
    <script src="https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/7.19.1/firebase-app.js"></script>
    <script src="https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/4.8.1/firebase.js"></script>
    <script>
      // Your web app's Firebase configuration
      var firebaseConfig = {
        apiKey: 'AIzaSyAVNeXl4cBro95I3dFWMaiT2rI88sqyBtc',
        authDomain: 'loginauth-12.firebaseapp.com',
        databaseURL: 'https://loginauth-12.firebaseio.com',
        projectId: 'loginauth-12',
        storageBucket: 'loginauth-12.appspot.com',
        messagingSenderId: '308714255384',
        appId: '1:308714255384:web:98e87065f0e45910f0ff6d',
      }
      // Initialize Firebase
      firebase.initializeApp(firebaseConfig)
    </script>
    <script src="script.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

#### JavaScript

The javaScript is in the `script.js` file present in your repl just below the `index.html` file. JavaScript handles the logic of your webpage.

Here you only have to write a small amount of JavaScript code because Firebase has some pre-defined methods for authentication. Checkout [Firebase Documentation on web authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/start) for more information.

So you have to get the currently signed-in user you created on Firebase.

In the `script.js` file you need to call a method to [Get the currently signed-in user](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/manage-users#get_the_currently_signed-in_user), it is the method which specifies whether the user is signed-in or not.

```javascript
firebase.auth().onAuthStateChanged(function (user) {
  if (user) {
    // User is signed in.
  } else {
    // No user is signed in.
  }
})
```

Now we can show the division with ID `login_div` at the login page and the division with ID `user_div` when the user is signed-in.

Add the two lines of code below in the `if` condition of the code above.

```javascript
document.getElementById('user_div').style.display = 'block'
document.getElementById('login_div').style.display = 'none'
```

The code should look like this:

```javascript
firebase.auth().onAuthStateChanged(function (user) {
  if (user) {
    // User is signed in.
    document.getElementById('user_div').style.display = 'block'
    document.getElementById('login_div').style.display = 'none'
  } else {
    // No user is signed in.
  }
})
```

In the code above `block` will display the division and `none` will hide it.

You added the part for the signed-in user so you now need the `else` part. This is where the user isn't signed in. The code will be the same as the code in the first `if` but you need to swap `block` and `none` to display only `main_div` with ID `login_div`.

Add the following code to the `else` condition:

```javascript
document.getElementById('user_div').style.display = 'none'
document.getElementById('login_div').style.display = 'block'
```

The JavaScript code should look like:

```javascript
firebase.auth().onAuthStateChanged(function (user) {
  if (user) {
    // User is signed in.
    document.getElementById('user_div').style.display = 'block'
    document.getElementById('login_div').style.display = 'none'
  } else {
    // No user is signed in.
    document.getElementById('user_div').style.display = 'none'
    document.getElementById('login_div').style.display = 'block'
  }
})
```

Now, how it looks like:

![with JS](https://cloud-e3wysrojq.vercel.app/c1.png)

Now you need to work on both the functions you assigned to HTML buttons (`login()` and `logout()`).

##### Function login()

A user can sign-in only if their record is stored in Firebase. Firebase has a method called [`Sign-in existing user`](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/start#sign_in_existing_users) that allows existing users to sign in using their email address and password.

Now you need to create two variables in `login()` named `userEmail` and `userPass`. They get email and password values from the input fields with IDs `email_field` and `password_field`.

```javascript
function login() {
  var userEmail = document.getElementById('email_field').value
  var userPass = document.getElementById('password_field').value
}
```

So you need to add the method [`Sign-in existing user`](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/start#sign_in_existing_users) inside the `login()`.

```javascript
firebase
  .auth()
  .signInWithEmailAndPassword(email, password)
  .catch(function (error) {
    // Handle Errors here.
    var errorCode = error.code
    var errorMessage = error.message
    // ...
  })
```

In the code above replace `email` with `userEmail` and `password` with `userPass`.

You also need to display an error message when an error occurs like _wrong email or password_, so add the code below inside `Sign-in existing user` method.

```javascript
window.alert('Error : ' + errorMessage)
```

So your code should look like this:

```javascript
function login() {
  var userEmail = document.getElementById('email_field').value
  var userPass = document.getElementById('password_field').value

  firebase
    .auth()
    .signInWithEmailAndPassword(userEmail, userPass)
    .catch(function (error) {
      // Handle Errors here.
      var errorCode = error.code
      var errorMessage = error.message

      window.alert('Error : ' + errorMessage)

      // ...
    })
}
```

##### Function logout()

For logout add the following code below the login function:

```javascript
function logout() {
  firebase.auth().signOut()
}
```

Here is your final JavaScript code:

```javascript
firebase.auth().onAuthStateChanged(function (user) {
  if (user) {
    // User is signed in.

    document.getElementById('user_div').style.display = 'block'
    document.getElementById('login_div').style.display = 'none'
  } else {
    // No user is signed in.

    document.getElementById('user_div').style.display = 'none'
    document.getElementById('login_div').style.display = 'block'
  }
})

function login() {
  var userEmail = document.getElementById('email_field').value
  var userPass = document.getElementById('password_field').value

  firebase
    .auth()
    .signInWithEmailAndPassword(userEmail, userPass)
    .catch(function (error) {
      // Handle Errors here.
      var errorCode = error.code
      var errorMessage = error.message

      window.alert('Error : ' + errorMessage)

      // ...
    })
}

function logout() {
  firebase.auth().signOut()
}
```

Your website should look like this üëá

![live](https://cloud-meubu1zac.vercel.app/0login_2.1.gif)

Try logging in with the email and password you stored in Firebase. If it worked you should be all set!

As you can see, the main goal of this workshop is completed here. To make your webpage look cool you need to add some custom CSS.

#### CSS

The `style.css` file present in your repl just below `script.js` gives styles and designs to your webpage.

You just need to:

- Mention element/ class name/ ID.
- Open curly brackets `{`.
- Add styles.
- Close curly brackets `}` .

Here how you can add styles to your `<body>` tag:

```CSS
body {
  background: #000000;
  color: #fff;
  padding: 0px;
  margin: 0px;
  font-family: 'Nunito', sans-serif;
  font-size: 16px;
}
```

This way you can add styles to divisions, ids, and the whole webpage. Inspect my [CSS file](https://repl.it/@tanishqsoni/Loginauth#style.css).

You can select different colors from a [color picker](https://www.google.com/search?q=color+picker) to give your webpage a cool colorful look.

If you need help regarding the various keywords used in CSS you can go through the [CSS documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference).

Yayyy üéä! You are done!!

Take a look at the [final code](https://repl.it/@tanishqsoni/Loginauth).
