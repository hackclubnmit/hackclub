# Simple Calculator

Today, We'll be building a simple yet fun calculator in React.

[![Simple Calculator](https://cloud-ht4su332c.vercel.app/0image.png)](https://5trtj.csb.app/)

Here's the [source code](https://codesandbox.io/s/workshopcalculator-5trtj).

## Part 1: Prerequisites

You should know some basics of React and I recommend you to follow [this](https://workshops.hackclub.com/react_calendar/) workshop before proceeding further. If you're having trouble, feel free to ask [me](https://app.slack.com/client/T0266FRGM/user_profile/U014ND5P1N2) or anyone in the [Hack Club Slack](https://hackclub.com/slack/)!

## Part 2: Setup

For writing our code, we'll be using [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io) which turns out to be the best online code editor for React.

To get started, go to this [starter code](https://codesandbox.io/s/workshopcalculatorstarter-1d07f). Press **`ctrl+s`** / **`cmd+s`** and it will automatically fork it for you. Now, we have everything set up so let's get started!

## Part 3: Building the project

### 1) The Starter Code

Let's first have a look at our project's starter code.

First, there are 2 main directories and a `package.json` file. We'll ignore the `package.json` file for now and let's have a look at the 2 directories, namely, `public/` and `src/`.

Usually, the `public/` directory contains an HTML file and all your assets. We won't be touching the `public/` directory during the whole workshop, not even the HTML file!

Next is the `src/` directory which contains all your JavaScript files and your CSS files. We have an `index.js` file, which basically renders our React code. The `style.css` file is already written for you.

Next is the `App.js` file. It looks something like this:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react'
import './styles.css'

const operatorsArr = ['*', '/', '+', '.', '-']

export default function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <h1>React Calculator</h1>
      <div className="calc-wrapper"></div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Explanation: Here, `useState` is already imported for you as we'll be using it in the later part of the workshop. Next, there's an array containing all the basic operators. The `App` component simply renders a heading and a `div` with a `className` of `calc-wrapper` for now.

Next, if we look in the `components/` directory, we have a `Button` component and a `components.css` file.

### 2) Creating the `Button` component.

Let us start building the `Button` component.

First we'll create a function `isNum` inside the component which checks if a value is a number or not.

```jsx
const Button = () => {
  const isNum = (val) => {
    if (!isNaN(val) || val === 'C' || val === '.') {
      return true
    }
    return false
  }
}
```

Explanation: We create a function named `isNum` which takes in a `val` as an argument. Then it checks whether the `val` is a number or `C` (clear) or a decimal (`.`), if any of the condition is true, it returns `true` or else it simply returns `false`.

Next we'll create a function to check whether a value is an equal sign or not.

```jsx
const Button = ({ children, onClick, isInput }) => {
  // ...

  const isEqual = (val) => {
    if (val === '=') {
      return true
    }
    return false
  }
}
```

Explanation: This is a quite simple function which takes in a value as an argument and checks whether the value is an equal sign or not and returns `true`/`false` accordingly.

Now its time to render some jsx in this component. This is going to be a bit tricky and will make use of `props`. So try to concentrate and understand what we are writing and you'll surely not be confused.

There will be 3 main props we'll be using in this component.

1. `children` - This prop is the value which will be passed to the component's opening and closing tags.

Example:

```jsx
<Button>7</Button> // Here, 7 is the children of that component.
```

2. `onClick` - This prop will simply store the functions which we'll create later for our calculator. This function will be passed to the Button component's `onClick`.

3. `isInput` - This prop will work as a boolean for us and help us to determine whether the component will render the `input` state's value or not.

**NOTE:** We haven't yet created the `input` state but we'll be doing it soon in few minutes.

```jsx
const Button = ({ children, onClick, isInput }) => { // <-- Props
  const isNum = (val) => {...};
  const isEqual = (val) => {...};

  return (
    <>
      {isInput ? (
        <div className="input">{children}</div>
      ) : (
        <div
          className={`button-wrapper button ${isEqual(children) ?"equal-btn" : null} ${isNum(children) ? null : "operator"}`}
          onClick={() => onClick(children)}>
          {children}
        </div>
      )}
    </>
  );
};
```

Explanation: First we accepted the 3 props in this component. Now here comes the tricky part.

We use `fragments` as the parent element of the `jsx`. Fragments let you group a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM.

**NOTE:** `<></>` is known as fragments.

Then we have used [`ternary operators`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Conditional_Operator) to render different `div` accordingly. If the `isInput` is true, it will render the `div` with the `className` of `input` or else it will render another `div`.

Notice that in the second `div`, we have again used `ternary operators` to determine that `div`'s `className`. We call the `isEqual` function passing it the value of `children` and if it returns `true`, it will add a `className` of `equal-btn` to the `div`. We have also called the `isNum` function passing it the same value of `children` and if it returns `true`, it will add a classname of `operator` to the `div`.

Next we give an `onClick` attribute to the `div` which will simply call the `onClick` function which also takes in the `children` as an argument.

**NOTE:** The `onClick` funtion will be passed down by the parent component to this component.

And lastly, we simply render out the `children` of the component.

I hope I wasn't vague in explaining you what the code is doing. If you are still confused, try to read the code and understand it again. Or else, feel free to reach me out on slack!

By this, we finish our `Button` component and now its time to render it out in the main parent component (`App`) and also pass the appropriate `props` to it.

<detail><summary>Your code so far:</summary>

```jsx
import React from "react";
import "./components.css";

const Button = ({ children, onClick, isInput }) => {
  const isNum = (val) => {
    if (!isNaN(val) || val === "C" || val === ".") {
      return true;
    }
    return false;
  };

  const isEqual = (val) => {
    if (val === "=") {
      return true;
    }
    return false;
  };

  return (
    <>
      {isInput ? (
        <div className="input">{children}</div>
      ) : (
        <div
          className={`button-wrapper button ${
            isEqual(children) ? "equal-btn" : null
          } ${isNum(children) ? null : "operator"}`}
          onClick={() => onClick(children)}
        >
          {children}
        </div>
      )}
    </>
  );
};

export default Button;
```

</details>

You've done great so far! And I recommend you to relax and take a 5 minutes break!

### 3) Creating the `App` component.

Let's render the `Button` component in our `App` component. We'll first import it in the `App` component.

```jsx
import Button from "./components/Button";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <h1>React Calculator</h1>
      <div className="calc-wrapper">
        <Button isInput></Button>
        <div className="row">
          <Button>7</Button>
          <Button>8</Button>
          <Button>9</Button>
          <Button>/</Button>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Explanation: Inside the `calc-wrapper`, we first add a `Button` with a prop of `isInput`. This means that `isInput` will be `true` for this component and as we haven't passed the `isInput` prop to any other `Button`, it will be `false` for those components. Next, we create a `row` and add 4 `Buttons` to it, and as `row` has a property of `flex`, it will be displayed nicely on the browser as a row! We also passed the numbers `7, 8, 9` and the operator `/` as children to those buttons respectively.

Your preview should look something like this:

![Preview output of the code written so far](https://cloud-5g2s0vw25.vercel.app/0image.png)

Excellent! Wondering how they got different colors even if they were the same component? This is why we created the functions `isNum()` and `isEqual()`. They check what the value of the children is and give the `className` accordingly! Isn't it cool?

Also wondering how the first `Button` component looks different than the others? This is because the `isInput` boolean prop is true for that component and the way we have built our `Button` component is it checks whether the `isInput` is truthy and displays a different `div` accordingly!

We just created the 4 buttons of our calculator! 

**Challenge:** Can you try to add the rest of the buttons in a similar manner?

**Hints:**

1. Use rows for each group of buttons.

2. Check how the final output looks like and try to implement exactly like that!

<detail><summary>Here's the solution:</summary>

```jsx
export default function App() {

  return (
    <div className="App">
      <h1>React Calculator</h1>
      <div className="calc-wrapper">
        <Button isInput></Button>
        <div className="row">
          <Button>7</Button>
          <Button>8</Button>
          <Button>9</Button>
          <Button>/</Button>
        </div>
        <div className="row">
          <Button>4</Button>
          <Button>5</Button>
          <Button>6</Button>
          <Button>*</Button>
        </div>
        <div className="row">
          <Button>1</Button>
          <Button>2</Button>
          <Button>3</Button>
          <Button>+</Button>
        </div>
        <div className="row">
          <Button>.</Button>
          <Button>0</Button>
          <Button>C</Button>
          <Button>-</Button>
        </div>
        <div className="row">
          <Button>=</Button>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

</details>

Now your preview window should look something like this!

You might have understood that we have finally completed our calculator's UI! Now all that remains is to make appropriate functions for our calculator to work as well as pass appropriate `props` to the `Buttons`!

![Woohoo you did a great job!](https://media.giphy.com/media/3NtY188QaxDdC/giphy.gif)

### 4) Creating The Functions For Our Calculator.

Let us first create an `input` state which will store all the buttons pressed by the user and also help us in displaying the calculations.

```jsx
export default function App() {
  const [input, setInput] = useState(""); // Creating the state

  // ...
}
```

Next, let's create a function which will store the numbers clicked by the user in the `input` state.

**NOTE:** We'll create seperate functions for operators and numbers as we don't want the ability to press the operators more than once simultaneously but the numbers can be pressed any number of times we want. If you are confused, don't worry! You'll get it in a minute.

```jsx
export default function App() {
  const [input, setInput] = useState("");

  function inputNum(val) {
    setInput(input + val);
  }

  // ...
}
```

Explanation: We create a function `inputNum` which will take `val` as an argument. Then, we simply append it to the current stored value in the `input`.

Now, we'll make a similar but tricky function for operators. Don't worry, It'll be a little confusing if you look at it the first time.

```jsx
function inputNum(val) {...}

function inputOperator(val) {
  if (input === "" || (operatorsArr.includes(input[input.length - 1]) && operatorsArr.includes(val))
  ) {
    return;
  } else {
    setInput(input + val);
  }
}

  // ...
```

Explanation: We first create a function `inputOperator` which also takes in a `val` as an argument. Then, we make use of `if-else` statements to check certain conditions.

First, it checks whether the `input` is empty or not. (We definitely don't want the user to click on the operator if there's no number present in the `input`). If this condition is not true, then it moves ahead to the next condition.

`input[input.length - 1]` means the last value of the `input` string. Suppose `input` is `12%2*`, then the last value here is `*`, therefore `input[input.length - 1]` here is equal to `*`. Also, `operatorsArr.includes()` is a function which checks whether a certain value is in an array or not.

So we basically check whether the `operatorsArr` includes the last value of the `input` or not. If this condition is true, it again moves to the next condition which checks whether the `val` argument is included in the `operatorsArr` or not.

**What does this mean?** In simple language, it simply checks if the previously pressed value by the user is an operator or not while also checking if the newly pressed value (`val`) is again, an operator or not. This will mean that the user pressed the operators 2 times simultaneously. Thus, it will be prevented.

If the first condition is true alone, the function will simply return nothing. Also if the second and the third condition both are true, it will do the same.

If all the conditions turn out to be false, finally it will update the `input` state with the `val`.

Woah that was a pretty big brain! I hope you understood what and why we wrote this code.

![WOAH!!!](https://media.giphy.com/media/3o6ZtmGkSCwGWQNTOg/giphy.gif)


Now, we'll make use of the library `mathjs` which, if you look in the project dependencies, it is already installed for you. We only need to import it in our project and the functions in it will be ready to use.

![mathjs already installed](https://cloud-9gtba7h1z.vercel.app/0image.png)

Next, on line 4 of `App.js` we'll import it.

```jsx
import * as math from "mathjs";
```

Now, every function inside that library is stored in `math`.

Next, we'll create a function to evaluate our calculations.

```jsx
function inputOperator(val) {...}

function evaluate() {
  if (input === "" || operatorsArr.includes(input[input.length - 1])) {
    return input;
  } else {
    setInput(math.evaluate(input));
  }
}
```

Explanation: This function checks if the `input` is empty or if the last value of the input is an operator. If these conditions are true, this will mean that the `input` can't be evaluated. So, it will simply return the `input`. If everything's perfect and the conditions turn out to be false, it will make use of the `evaluate()` function in the `mathjs` library and simply evaluate the `input`!

And here we complete all the necessary functions for the calculator to work!

The last thing which is remaining is passing the appropriate `props` to the `Button` components which will complete our project!

### 5) Passing The Appropriate `props` To The `Button` Components.

For the very first `Button` component, we have passed the `isInput` prop to it, we'll also pass `input` as the `children` to that component.

```jsx
return (
  <div className="App">
    <h1>React Calculator</h1>
    <div className="calc-wrapper">
      <Button isInput>{input}</Button>
      {/* ... */}
    </div>
  </div>
)
```

Next, for each `Button` which has a number as their `children`, we'll pass `onClick={inputNum}` prop to it. And for each `Button` which has an operator as their `children` (including the decimal `.`) we'll pass `onClick={inputOperator}` prop to it.

For the button which has '`=`' as its children, we'll pass `onClick={evaluate}` prop to it.

Lastly, for the Button which has '`C`' (clear) as its children, we'll pass `onClick` and also create an inline function which will simply clear the state.

<details>
<summary>After passing all the props, here's what it should look like:</summary>

```jsx
return (
  <div className="App">
    <h1>React Calculator</h1>
    <div className="calc-wrapper">
      <Button isInput>{input}</Button>
      <div className="row">
        <Button onClick={inputNum}>7</Button>
        <Button onClick={inputNum}>8</Button>
        <Button onClick={inputNum}>9</Button>
        <Button onClick={inputOperator}>/</Button>
      </div>
      <div className="row">
        <Button onClick={inputNum}>4</Button>
        <Button onClick={inputNum}>5</Button>
        <Button onClick={inputNum}>6</Button>
        <Button onClick={inputOperator}>*</Button>
      </div>
      <div className="row">
        <Button onClick={inputNum}>1</Button>
        <Button onClick={inputNum}>2</Button>
        <Button onClick={inputNum}>3</Button>
        <Button onClick={inputOperator}>+</Button>
      </div>
      <div className="row">
        <Button onClick={inputOperator}>.</Button>
        <Button onClick={inputNum}>0</Button>
        <Button onClick={() => setInput("")}>C</Button>
        <Button onClick={inputOperator}>-</Button>
      </div>
      <div className="row">
        <Button onClick={evaluate}>=</Button>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
);
```

</details>

With this, we finish building our calculator! It also works as we expected it to.
